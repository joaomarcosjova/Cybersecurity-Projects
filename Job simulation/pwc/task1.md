# Task Submission: PowerPoint Set for Information Risk Management



## Part 1: Due Care vs. Due Diligence in Risk Management

We need to consider the information provided in the voicemail. Start by distinguishing **due care** from **due diligence** in the context of **information risk management**. Use this understanding to analyze **what Boldi AG did wrong** in their approach. Was the issue a failure of **due care**, **due diligence**, or both?

Our Cybersecurity team will include your findings in the final pitch presentation, along with your detailed explanation.


## Part 2: Key Principles of Defense Against Risks

Based on the key principles of defense, Boldi AG has several options for mitigating or containing damage from risks. These options can be summarized using the acronym **Deter, Detect, Prevent, Avoid**:

1. **Deter**: Measures that discourage potential attackers from attempting to breach security.
2. **Detect**: Systems in place to identify security incidents or breaches as they occur.
3. **Prevent**: Mechanisms to block or stop attacks before they cause harm.
4. **Avoid**: Strategies to eliminate or transfer risk entirely.

Before sending your findings to **Stefan**, please think about how **Boldi AG** can react to an attack similar to the one experienced by their competitor. You will need to include this response on one PowerPoint slide of your deck.
